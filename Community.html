                    There’s always plenty going on in Ryman’s warm and vibrant communities. Residents get involved in art exhibitions, fashion shows, music and dance performances, and a huge range of outings. The memories and moments of shared joy created from these activities
                    and events is what life is all about. We love to capture those moments, so residents can share them with their family and friends. And it’s not only residents that get involved! Our village staff also get in on the action, participating
                    in events and telling their own stories. Plus, we as a company like to share the events, achievements and milestones that resonate with us as a whole. Enjoy.

                    Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts. After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. Breast cancer can occur in both men and women, but it's far more common in women.Breast
                    cancer survival rates have increased, Substantial support for breast cancer awareness and research funding has helped created advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. and the number of deaths associated with this disease
                    is steadily declining, largely due to factors such as earlier detection, a new personalized approach to treatment and a better understanding of the disease. Doctors estimate that about 5 to 10 percent of breast cancers are linked to
                    gene mutations passed through generations of a family. A number of inherited mutated genes that can increase the likelihood of breast cancer have been identified. The most well-known are breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer
                    gene 2 (BRCA2), both of which significantly increase the risk of both breast and ovarian cancer. If you have a strong family history of breast cancer or other cancers, your doctor may recommend a blood test to help identify specific
                    mutations in BRCA or other genes that are being passed through your family. Consider asking your doctor for a referral to a genetic counselor, who can review your family health history. A genetic counselor can also discuss the benefits,
                    risks and limitations of genetic testing to assist you with shared decision-making. Later, need to concult the doctor for further examination to rectify the issue.
