<h5> FREEDOM TO LIVE THE WAY YOU WANT </h5>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6"></div>

    <p id="txt1">
        Jaika Retirement Village offers living choices to suit everyone, so residents can live the way they want and blaze their own trails. Our townhouses are light and spacious, with clean lines and a clever open plan design layout that provides an easy flow
        throughout.
        <br>
        <br> If down the track you need more support, we offer assisted living in a serviced apartment along with resthome and hospital care. That freedom and flexibility is empowering for residents and knowing care can be dialled up as needed means,
        quite simply, ‘no worries’.

    </p>

    <h5> ENJOY A LITTLE CERTAINTY </h5>

    <p id="txt1">
        Our pioneering approach to retirement living includes resident-friendly terms designed to protect you and your family. Our base weekly fee is fixed for the entire time you occupy your apartment or townhouse*, and our deferred management fee is capped
        at 20 percent – one of the lowest in the retirement sector.
        <br>
        <br> These are just some of the ways we’re pioneering a new way of living for a new retirement generation.
        <br> *Some conditions apply.

    <h5 id="txt"> CARE WHEN YOU NEED IT </h5>
    <br>


    <p id="txt1">
        Care is not an ‘add on’ at a our village, it is built into the fabric of our villages from the very beginning. It’s comforting for couples and friends to know they can still be near each other even if their health needs are different.

        <br>
        <br> Jaika's care centre offers a full range of care options including resthome, hospital and specialist dementia care. Like all aspects of our villages, we constantly look for ways to improve both the care we provide and the innovation behind
        it. Care is customised using our myPoineer care app and residents love the food in our seasonal Delicious menu, which is prepared fresh on site by village chefs.

        <br>
        <br> Jaika's Poineer is one of over 80 percent of our villages that have been awarded 4-year certification by the Ministry of Health. It’s recognised as the ‘gold star’ standard in care.
